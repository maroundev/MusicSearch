Music Search

This app uses public APIs to construct a music search application.

The public APIs are:

https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=tom+waits
http://lyrics.wikia.com/api.php?func=getSong&artist=Tom+Waits&song=new+coat+of+paint&fmt=json

A user is able to search for a term in the SearchTableViewController, view detailed results and then view the lyric if available in the LyricsViewController.
